\f0\fs28 \cf0 To run simulations, execute scripts that begin with \'91protocol\'92, all other files are helper functions with their usage explained in details in the project report.\
\
- for 3-agent cases, run 
\b protocol_movingObs_3.m\

\b0 - for 10-agent cases, run 
\b protocol_movingObs_10.m\

\b0 - for 20-agent cases, run 
\b protocol_movingObs_20.m / protocol_noObs_20.m\
\

\b0 To run simulations with 3-agent and 10-agent without any obstacles (ClassB), please refer to documentations in scripts for instructions.\
\
Note: parameters 
\b de
\b0  and 
\b dc
\b0  in the main execution scripts can be adjusted to avoid crashing when running different setups (initial/goal locations as well as number of agents). However, you also need to change 
\b de
\b0  and 
\b dc
\b0  in the following scripts to match in order for the program to work properly.\
- 
\b de
\b0  in 
\b calc_uik.m\

\b0 - 
\b dc
\b0  in
\b  calc_uio.m\

\b0 - 
\b dr
\b0  (=de) and 
\b dc 
\b0 in 
\b sigma_generator.m\
